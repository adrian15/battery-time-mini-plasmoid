About this WattRate fork
------------------------
This WattRate fork shows either:
(3h5m) when you are charging
(Time to full)
or
3h5m when you are discharging
(Time to empty)

It only supports one battery.

My KDE 4.14.2 enhanced battery monitor (probably powermanagement dataengine fault)
was not showing remaining time at all.

So this is a workaround which queries upower itself directly via dbus.

Original WattRate which was designed with showing consumption in mind can be found at:

Plasma Applet Template
----------------------

You need KDE 4.2

-- Build instructions --

cd where_pkg_is_extracted
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ../
make 
make install

(your $KDEDIRS is where you install your KDE 4)

Restart plasma to load the applet 
kquitapp plasma-desktop
plasma-desktop

or view it with 
plasmoidviewer wattrate

You might need to run kbuildsycoca4
in order to get the .desktop file recognized.
